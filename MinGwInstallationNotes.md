# MinGW Installation Notes #
Projects will be run on a Windows machine. MinGW-W64 was chosen to be able to run the GCC compiler on Windows. A windows installer was downloaded from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/ "Sourceforge").  

The following settings was chosen in the installer  
- Version: 6.2.0  
- Architecture: x86_64  
- Threads: posix  
- Exception: seh  
- Build revision: 0  

It is likely best to have a an installation folder without spaces in the path so it was chosen to be - C:\mingw-w64\x86_64-6.2.0-posix-seh-rt_v5-rev0
